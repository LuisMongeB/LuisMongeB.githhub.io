# Luis Monge's Website
As part of the coursework for CS50: Introduction to Computer Science I created a website using HTML, CSS, JS aided by Bootstrap 5. Here you can get to know me a little bit better :) 


This website is my first experience building a with HTML, CSS and JS. I did not have to do everything from scratch since I was aided by Bootstrap 5. 

This provided me with an opportunity to tell you a little bit more about me while at the same time putting newfound skills into practice. I'm sure it is not anywhere near a perfect website but I am very happy with result.
