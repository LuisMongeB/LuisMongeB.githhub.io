In the moment I did not do it to improve my future, get a career or give me any benefit but I have realized curiosity does something very important, it does not allow my mind to stay fixed for too long. As my favorite book says: </p>

                            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/351709-it-s-the-questions-we-can-t-answer-that-teach-us-the">
                                <p>It's the questions we can't answer that teach us the most. They teach us how to think. If you give a man an answer, all he gains is a little fact. But give him a question and he'll look for his own answers.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify intellectual-curiosity-paragraph">Just like Kvothe, the main character, being curious has led me to look for my own answers and dive deep on knowledge about the world around me.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify growth-mindset-paragraph">It is easy to add growth mindset to a curriculum or mention it during an interview. But it is better to lead by example. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify growth-mindset-paragraph">I was raised in an extremely singular environment which allowed me to engage in different social and intellectual realities. I had to get confortable with ambiguity and uncertainty, at first without knowing and then as a choice. In fact, it does not matter what we do and how much we plan, if we cannot be confortable with uncertainty and ambiguity we will have a hard time in this life. A growth mindset has certainly not come by coincidence in my life. In part, it has been a willful choice but it is clear how the people that have surrounded me have perhaps unintentionally stimulated it. Sometimes I'm the plant that has to water itself, but always the people around me have been a fertile forest in which to grow.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify growth-mindset-paragraph">A growth mindset has certainly not come by coincidence in my life. It has been a very intentional choice I do every day but it is clear how the people that have surrounded me have perhaps unintentionally stimulated it. Sometimes I'm the plant that has to water itself, but always the people around me have been a fertile forest in which to grow.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify intentionality-paragraph">This life is too short and my mind reminds me of it constantly. For me intentionality is about <strong>being present</strong> when doing anything. It is very easy to be distracted in modern-day life and to go through life doing stuff just for doing it without purpose.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify intentionality-paragraph">My mind tends to always be working at full speed towards my objectives, ideas and work. Sometimes in the middle of this I find myself contributing to my future by missing some of my present.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify intentionality-paragraph">It is precisely in these moments where I am the most intentional about being in the <em>here and now.</em> Not surprising at all, this contributes to my wellbeing and to perform better at work. To have <strong>ownership</strong> about my projects and to actively listen to my colleagues and friends.</p>

                        There are way too many aspects that make living abroad great for me. For starters, living in Bologna (with its diverse and international student population) has allowed me to meet people from every corner of the planet. On a daily basis I get to speak between 3 and 4 languages as opposed to just Spanish back in Costa Rica. As for the Italy specific aspects, I absolutely love to wake up in the morning and go read at a bar with a cornetto and a cappuccino! If I can start my day like this, I have time to mentally prepare for anything that gets thrown at me.
